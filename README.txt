This processing job is to read the input from various data files, aggregate this file and provide analysis based on various criteria. Since the number of input files are more than the number of thread, each thread reads a file puts the data read into a shared variable and then goes ahead with reading the next file. In this way each thread reads multiple files thus enabling parallel processing. Once all the files are read, the shared variable has data from all the files the aggregation of data based on various attributes is done. Also when a SIGTERM signal is given the job ends and writes the present state(shared variables) of the job on to the disk which is read on the next run to continue the process. The UserInput is another thread used to take the SIGTERM input from user during the processing and end the processing.
